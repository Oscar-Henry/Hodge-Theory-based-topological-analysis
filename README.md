# Hodge-Theory-based-topological-analysis

This repository aim to propose an algorithm that:
- From a cloud points of a biomolecular structure compute the Rips complexes for different threshold epsilon
- Use the Rips complexes to evaluate the euclidian cochain on the edges
- Compute the gradient part of the Hodge decomposition by project the cochain on the zero coboundary map
- Compute the harmonic and curl part of the Hodge decomposition by substracting the gradient part of the Hodge decomposition to the euclidian cochain

- Show illustration and representation of this processus in a notebook.
